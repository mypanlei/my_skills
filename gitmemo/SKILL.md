description: "Long-term memory for AI agents via local .mem git repo. Interfaces: search, read, write, delete. MUST be used when starting tasks (search past), after completing tasks (write), before/after context compression (write then re-read), or when user mentions memory/.mem."

# GitMemo — AI Agent Long-Term Memory

Scripts: `<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.sh` (Linux/macOS) | `<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1` (Windows).

Path semantics:
- Script lookup: always resolve `mem.sh`/`mem.ps1` from the **skill installation directory** (`<SKILL_DIR>/scripts`), not from the current project directory. This supports global skill installation.
- Memory repo location: `.mem` is always in the **current project root** (working directory), and is auto-located/created there.
- Plain-directory guard: if `.mem/.gitmemo-mode` contains `plain`, GitMemo will keep `.mem/entries/` as a normal directory and refuse git-backed memory commands instead of silently recreating `.mem` as a nested Git repo. Use this only when you intentionally want `.mem` versioned by the main repository.

## Commands

### init
```bash
bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.sh init
```
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1" init
```

### search
```bash
bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.sh search <keywords_csv> [skip] [--mode <and|or|auto>]
```
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1" search <keywords_csv> [skip] [--mode <and|or|auto>]
```
- `keywords_csv`: comma-separated. `skip`: pagination offset (default 0). Up to 20 results/call, format: `hash|title|date`
- `mode`(default `auto`): `and`=strict, `or`=broad, `auto`=try `and` then fallback `or`

### read
```bash
bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.sh read <commit_hash>
```
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1" read <commit_hash>
```

### write

Use one of these short patterns:

Preferred (--content-file):
~~~bash
tmp_md="$(mktemp)"
cat > "$tmp_md" <<'MD'
<entry_markdown>
MD
bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.sh write   --title "[module] action + object"   --content-file "$tmp_md"   --body "<commit_body>"
~~~
~~~powershell
$tmpMd = Join-Path $env:TEMP ("gitmemo-" + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString() + ".md")
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($tmpMd, "<entry_markdown>", [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1" write --title "[module] action + object" --content-file $tmpMd --body "<commit_body>"
~~~

Windows-friendly direct file flow:
~~~powershell
$entry = '.mem\entries\20260310T000000Z-module-action-object.md'
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($entry, "<entry_markdown>", [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1" write --title "[module] action + object" --file $entry --body "<commit_body>"
~~~

- Prefer --content-file; --content stays compatibility-only, and temp files passed via --content-file are auto-deleted after a successful write.
- --file is optional, accepts entries/foo.md, .mem/entries/foo.md, and absolute paths under .mem/entries, and commits existing entry files directly.
- If --content-file already points inside .mem/entries, write reuses it in place and auto-syncs the .mem branch to the current repo branch.
### delete
```bash
bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.sh delete <commit_hash>
```
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/mem.ps1" delete <commit_hash>
```

## Commit Message (--title + --body)

**--title**: `[module] action + object` (e.g. `[auth] add rate-limit for login`)

**--body**: 1-3 sentence summary + metadata (must match front matter):
```
Added per-IP rate limiting (10 req/min) to login endpoint.

## Workflow

1. **Search**: extract 3-5 keywords → `search` → select top 5 relevant (by keyword overlap, title, recency) → `read` → reuse or reference. Paginate with `skip=20`, then `skip=40` (and continue by +20 if needed).
2. **Write**: after completing repo-related task that produced valuable outcome (or user asked to remember) → get UTC time + repo info → build entry → `write`. Skip for: pure Q&A, incomplete tasks, non-repo work.
  Also skip for purely operational git actions (e.g., commit/push only) that do not produce a new implementation or analysis outcome.
3. **Delete + rewrite**: if user unsatisfied → `delete` → redo → `write` new memory.
