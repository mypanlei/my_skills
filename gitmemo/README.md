# GitMemo Skill

A fully automated skill that gives coding agents long-term memory through a **local** `.mem` Git repository. Git is the only dependency, and users do not need to run memory commands manually.

## Key Characteristics

- Extremely simple to use: once installed, no manual memory commands are needed in day-to-day tasks
- Fully automated: the agent runs `init`, `search`, `read`, `write`, and `delete` as part of normal task flow
- Local-only and offline-capable: memory is stored in a local `.mem` Git repository, with no cloud dependency
- Git-only dependency: no runtime dependency beyond Git
- Token-efficient: reuses prior conclusions through search instead of re-injecting repeated context
- Prevents context bloat: search-first workflow with a max read scope of 5 relevant memories
- Auditable: every memory action is visible in Git history
- Traceable: each memory can be traced and replayed from commit history
- Easy to manage: branch-aligned, delete-and-rewrite capable, and review-friendly text artifacts

## Overview

- Stores completed task outcomes as markdown entries under `.mem/entries/`
- Runs memory operations automatically (`init`, `search`, `read`, `write`, `delete`) during agent tasks
- Supports `search` match modes: `and`, `or`, and default `auto` (AND-first, OR fallback)
- Aligns the `.mem` branch with the current project branch during `write`
- Integrates with agent instruction files so all agents follow the same memory policy

## Git-Based vs Vector-DB Memory

| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best Fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Git-based memory (GitMemo) | Fully auditable and traceable via Git history; Git-only dependency and simple setup; naturally aligned with code branches and review workflows | Weaker semantic retrieval (mostly keyword/structured text driven); less efficient than vector indexes at very large scale; weaker cross-repo aggregation | Single-repo or small/medium teams that prioritize explainability, auditability, and low ops cost |
| Vector-database memory | Strong semantic search for paraphrases and fuzzy queries; scales well for large corpora and cross-project knowledge; can improve recall/ranking with rerankers | Requires extra infra (vector DB + embedding service); higher cost and ops complexity; usually less interpretable than Git history | Large knowledge bases, cross-project retrieval, and use cases that need high semantic recall |

## File Layout

- `SKILL.md`: skill definition and workflow rules
- `agents-template.md`: snippet to append to your agent instruction file
- `scripts/mem.ps1`: Windows runtime interface used by agents
- `scripts/mem.sh`: Linux/macOS runtime interface used by agents

## Installation

### 1. Manual Install (User-Executed)

Install into the current project from project root:

```bash
git clone https://gitlabe2.ext.net.nokia.com/fayang/gitmemo.git .agents/skills/gitmemo
```

Or use a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://gitlabe2.ext.net.nokia.com/fayang/gitmemo.git .agents/skills/gitmemo
```

Then copy `./.agents/skills/gitmemo/agents-template.md` into your tool's project instruction file:
Copy it as-is, including the marker lines `# >>> gitmemo:agents-template:start` and `# <<< gitmemo:agents-template:end`, so future project-mode auto installs can sync the managed block safely.

### 2. Fully Automated Install (Agent-Executed)

Use `INSTALL.md` as the execution contract for coding agents:

- [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)

Two automation modes are supported:

- Global install (for exact paths and tool-specific global rules, follow `INSTALL.md`)
- Project install to `<project_root>/.agents/skills/gitmemo`

Example one-sentence prompts:
- Install to global (auto-detect, best-effort)
```text
Follow https://gitlabe2.ext.net.nokia.com/fayang/gitmemo/-/blob/main/INSTALL.md and install gitmemo in global mode; auto-detect the current coding agent (copilot/cursor) and integrate agents-template.md using that tool's global rules defined in INSTALL.md; if detection is not reliable, explicitly ask for agent type; finally report installed path, commit, agent type, and instruction integration result.
```

- Install to global (explicit agent, recommended)
  - GitHub Copilot
  ```text
  Follow https://gitlabe2.ext.net.nokia.com/fayang/gitmemo/-/blob/main/INSTALL.md and install gitmemo in global mode, then integrate agents-template.md using GitHub Copilot global rules; finally report installed path, commit, and instruction integration result.
  ```
  - Cursor
  ```text
  Follow https://gitlabe2.ext.net.nokia.com/fayang/gitmemo/-/blob/main/INSTALL.md and install gitmemo in global mode, then integrate agents-template.md using Cursor global rules; finally report installed path, commit, and instruction integration result.
  ```
- Install to current project
```text
Follow https://gitlabe2.ext.net.nokia.com/fayang/gitmemo/-/blob/main/INSTALL.md and install gitmemo in project mode for the current repository, then report installed path, commit, and instruction integration sync result.
```

After installation, the agent handles `.mem` initialization, search, read, write, and delete automatically during tasks.

## Agent Workflow

### 1. Before Work: Search

1. Extract 3-5 keywords from the user request.
2. Run `search` with `skip=0`.
3. If more than 5 relevant results are returned, let the agent select only the 5 most likely memories (keyword overlap, title specificity, recency) before reading.
4. If not relevant, paginate with `skip=20` and `skip=40`.
5. If relevant memories exist, run `read` only on the selected memories and reuse conclusions when appropriate.

### 2. After Completion: Write

Write memory only when all are true:

- Task is complete
- Task is related to the current repository
- One of the following is true:
  - Outcome is valuable and reusable
  - User explicitly asked to remember this request/task

If the user explicitly asked to remember, that overrides the "valuable and reusable" requirement, but task completion and repository relevance are still required.

Do not write memory for incomplete tasks or requests unrelated to the current repository. For casual chat or pure Q&A, do not write unless the user explicitly asked to remember. For routine git operations (commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, tag, etc.) that don't involve code changes or problem-solving, do not write memory.

### 3. If User Is Unsatisfied: Delete and Rewrite

1. Run `delete <commit_hash>`
2. Redo the task based on feedback
3. Write a corrected memory entry
